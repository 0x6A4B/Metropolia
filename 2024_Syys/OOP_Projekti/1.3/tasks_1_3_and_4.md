# 1.3 Probability Distributions


### Task 1



(W) Suppose you are compiling statistics on the age structure of students in our group. You should then draw 1000 age values and these should be distributed in the same way as the age distribution of the students in the group. How do you do it? Explain the algorithm in enough details to be able to program it directly. Take an idea/model from the example on section Your own distribution.
