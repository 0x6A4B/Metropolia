# 1.2 Three Phase Simulation

### Task 1


a) Why does an arrival event need to generate a new arrival event?
  - As a discreet event simulation we do not run it real-time or time sliced based on time events, time passing by, but we need to use the event to generate a next time with an event so that we can jump to that time.
    The generated arrival event is our clock for the next arrival. It is also a booked event so isn't conditioned on some other event happening.
    The generation of input or arrival events keep the simulation queue running, without generating them the simulation will process already generated events and stop when finished with them.

b) Which event should be generated by the start of the service?
  - Arrival events for all routers so that we have our first events and time for them.





### Task 4




Continue with the three-phase simulation example (section Telephone call centre example: hand simulation) until one client of client type Y exits the system. Return your solution as an attachment to the solution of this exercise.
