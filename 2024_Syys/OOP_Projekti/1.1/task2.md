### Real-world operational system and identifying elements associated with it

#### Music festival

Music festivals are a large scale complex operational system where there are various elements, both human and non-human, that need to function co-operatively. There are a large number of customers, vendors, workers and artists that have to be operated smoothly to have the whole operation work in orderly and efficiently.

The vendors have logistics and infrastructure serving them while they are serving customers.

- The timing, storage and transportation of, especially food, products
  - There are a lot of variability in how and what is purchased and when
  - There is a lot of interconnectedness between sales types and demand with other functions in the festival
    Depending on what is happening on the stage, for example, has effect on people's movements and service needs
- Queueing, serving and billing of customers
  - Again the understanding of how people move and behave affects the needs and possibilities for the vendors
    During peak hours more workforce might be needed in serving the clientele
- Setting up and taking down of the sales points

Artists, their needs and their equipment

- Managing artists and their crews food, drink and accommodation
- Equipment setup, testing and takedown

Visitors, ticket sales and visitor movements

- Paths, locations and likely routes
  - Designing any kind of logistic or traffic systems is highly complex, interconnected and suffers from high variability
    There are possibilities to benefit from sophisticated simulational models in designing how traffic is going to develop and work in the festival environment
    The design of pathways and routes in amusement parks, malls and other high traffic environments must take in to account many different variables
    Where people are going to want to go after visiting a certain service
- Possible tents and accommodations
- Restaurant and other services


##### Example hotdog stand

- Ordering/Salespoint
  - Customer queue, space needed for queueing
  - Highly variable but possibly quite foreseeable demand
  - Connected to other elements and variables like time of day, movement of people etc
  - Not very complex
- Storage
  - Completely connected to sales and demand cycles
- Cashier
  - Directly connected to sales events but also connected to external billing systems when using electronic payments as is default today
