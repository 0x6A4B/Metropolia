Here's a short poem about Linux featuring a penguin who loves IRC:

Penny the Penguin, so proud and so fine,
Lives in the land of Linux, where freedom is mine.
She loves to code all day, with passion and fire,
But when night falls, she logs on to IRC, her heart's desire.

With Fedora as her throne, she connects with glee,
To Freenode and #linux, a haven for she.
The chatter flows like a stream, of ones and zeroes bright,
Penny's eyes shine like stars, in the dark of the night.

She talks of kernel tweaks, and distros so fine,
With fellow penguins and hackers, who share her design.
In this virtual realm, where code meets the eye,
Penny finds community, as she codes 'til she can't deny.

So here's to Penny, and all Linux lovers like her too,
May their scripts be efficient, and their servers always anew!
