## Reflection

Please use utilize this template to write your reflections.

### Challenges Faced:

Getting stable diffusion model that runs on my GPU, it's gonna be a bit of a challenge to run LLM and stable diffusion for the project as I have enough memory fo one of them and that barely. Will need to have a program or bash script that kills llm after it has generated needed text and make sure SD doesn't crash for out of memory issue and does indeed generate pictures.
Small hitch but has to be solved.

CSS and HTML for UI is always a nuisance for me, I should get better at it. Interesting to try if tailwind is more pleasurable
